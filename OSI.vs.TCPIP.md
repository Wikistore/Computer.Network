## OSI vs TCP/IP
## What is OSI model?

The OSI stands for Open System Interconnection, which was developed in 1980s. It is a conceptual model used for network communication. It is not implemented entirely, but it is still referenced today. This OSI model consists of seven layers, and each layer is connected to each other. The data moves down the OSI model, and each layer adds additional information. The data moves down until it reaches the last layer of the OSI model. When the data is received at the last layer of the OSI model, then the data is transmitted over the network. Once the data is reached on the other side, then the process will get reversed.

## What is TCP/IP model?

The TCP model stands for Transmission Control Protocol, whereas IP stands for Internet Protocol. A number of protocols that make the internet possibly comes under the TCP/IP model. Nowadays, we do not hear the name of the TCP/IP model much, we generally hear the name of the IPv4 or IPv6, but it is still valid. This model consists of 4 layers. Now, we will list down the diagrammatic representation of the TCP/IP model.
## OSI
- Application
High-level API. resource sharing ... 
- Presentation 
Data formating, encoding, encryption, compression 
- Session
Authentication, manage sessions and reconnections
- Transport
Manage segmentation, acknowledgment, reliable 
- Network
Nulti node routing and addressing 
- Data link
Flow and error control on physical link
- Physical 
Transmission of physical bit stream 

As we see in OSI model we have 7 layers but in TCP/IP it's 4 with update TCP/IP model. 
## TCP/IP
- Application 
- Transport 
- Internet
- Network Access
